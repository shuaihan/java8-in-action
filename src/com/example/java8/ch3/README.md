# Lambdas
- **Anonymous** — We say anonymous because it doesn’t have an explicit name like a method would normally have: less to write and think about!
- **Function** — We say function because a lambda isn’t associated with a particular class like a method is. But like a method, a lambda has a list of parameters, a body, a return type, and a possible list of exceptions that can be thrown.
- **Passed around** — A lambda expression can be passed as argument to a method or stored in a variable.
- **Concise** — You don’t need to write a lot of boilerplate like you do for anonymous classes.
