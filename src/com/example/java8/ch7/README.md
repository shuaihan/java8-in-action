# Parallel data processing 
## Before Java 7
1. First, you needed to explicitly split the data structure containing your data into subparts. 
2. Second, you needed to assign each of these subparts to a different thread. 
3. Third, you needed to synchronize them opportunely to avoid unwanted race conditions, wait for the completion of all threads, and finally combine the partial results. 

Java 7 introduced a framework called fork/join to perform these operations more consistently and in a less error-prone way.



## Java 8
- A parallel stream is a stream that splits its elements into multiple chunks, processing each chunk with a different thread. Thus, you can automatically partition the workload of a given operation on all the cores of your multicore processor and keep all of them equally busy.

# Using parallel streams effectively
- If in doubt, measure
- Watch out for boxing. Automatic boxing and unboxing operations can dramatically hurt performance.
- operations such as limit and findFirst that rely on the order of the elements are expensive in a parallel stream. For example, findAny will perform better than findFirst because it isnâ€™t constrained to operate in the encounter order. You can always turn an ordered stream into an unordered stream by invoking the method unordered on it
- For a small amount of data, choosing a parallel stream is almost never a winning decision.
```
if (task is small enough or no longer divisible) { 
	compute task sequentially
} else {
	split task in two subtasks
	call this method recursively possibly further splitting each subtask wait for the completion of all subtasks
	combine the results of each subtask
}


```

- Take into account how well the data structure underlying the stream decomposes. 
For instance, an ArrayList can be split much more efficiently than a LinkedList,

|source| decomposability|
|---|---|
|ArrayList| Excellent|
|LinkedList|Poor|
|IntStram.range| Excellent|
|Stream.iterate|poor|
|HashSet|Good|
|TreeSet|Good}

- Consider whether a terminal operation has a cheap or expensive merge step (for example, the combiner method in a Collector)
